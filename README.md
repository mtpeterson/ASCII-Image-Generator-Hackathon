# ASCII-Image-Generator-Hackathon
This is an ASCII Image Generator realized in Processing(Java) under a 4-hour time constraint

Credit to Milchreis for the well-documented image processing library [*processing-imagelprocessing*](https://github.com/milchreis/processing-imageprocessing). This library was used to get the tone of individual pixels and was a great example to learn how ASCII images work.

The entire project, along with pictures and videos, can be found on my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/185467187/Flow-Fields-Hackathon-Project).
